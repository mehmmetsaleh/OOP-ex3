= Design and implementation =
=============================
regarding the spaceship part I implemented each class as the given api
and created a Storage.java Interface which represents a general Storage of
the ship, which both Locker and LongTermStorage classes implement.
Also used the has-a relation between the Spaceship and the LongTermStorage
classes.

regarding the part that deals with hotels.
I created two comparator classes which both implement the method 
"Compare()" in order to sort according to Rating and Proximity.
Also in the proximity part I created another class "HotelDistance"
which I implemented in it the ability to have an Euclidian Distance
(which the Hotel class lacked) and used it to sort according to proximity.
this class resembles a Wrapper class of the class Hotel but it's not (no
inheritance was involved).

finally I tested all my classes in both parts of the excerice using Junit.
(In this paragraph I answer the whole questions that were asked in the pdf
of the excerise, also I made it all clear and simple in the actual implementation)
